I’m hoping to save myself some future blood, sweat, and tears by learning from the best in this course.\r\n            For reference, this has been me more times than I can say……….\r\n            \r\n            Revising his paper, the grad student is unable to replicate his own results Source: Lego Grad Student\r\n            The R4epi handbook has been a life saver during many of those times!\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            five fun facts.\r\n            I am an amateur fan of adventure sports. Prior to COVID-19, I began sky-diving and kite-surfing. I’ve run several marathons, have my deep-water scuba certification, and love to snowboard and surf.\r\n            I have traveled to 53 countries as per my last count.\r\n            I met Harry Potter in real life and he could not have been nicer.\r\n            I love music and music festivals and have been to Afrikaburn 3 times (pictured below).\r\n            I started getting tattoos late in life and am totally addicted.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n            \r\n              Jenn O’Keeffe\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                                  \r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              about me.\r\n              I am a second year PhD student in the Health Systems program in the department of International Health and I hold an MPH from Columbia University.
